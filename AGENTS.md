# AGENTS.md

Drop-in operating instructions for coding agents. Read this file before every task.

**Working code only. Finish the job. Plausibility is not correctness.**

This file follows the [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) open standard (Linux Foundation / Agentic AI Foundation). Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Aider, Devin, Amp read it natively. For tools that look elsewhere, symlink:

```bash
ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
ln -s AGENTS.md GEMINI.md
```

## 0. Non-negotiables

These rules override everything else in this file when in conflict:

1. **No flattery, no filler.** Skip openers like "Great question", "You're absolutely right", "Excellent idea", "I'd be happy to". Start with the answer or the action.
2. **Disagree when you disagree.** If the user's premise is wrong, say so before doing the work. Agreeing with false premises to be polite is the single worst failure mode in coding agents.
3. **Never fabricate.** Not file paths, not commit hashes, not API names, not test results, not library functions. If you don't know, read the file, run the command, or say "I don't know, let me check."
4. **Stop when confused.** If the task has two plausible interpretations, ask. Do not pick silently and proceed.
5. **Touch only what you must.** Every changed line must trace directly to the user's request. No drive-by refactors, reformatting, or "while I was in there" cleanups.

---

## 1. Before writing code

**Goal: understand the problem and the codebase before producing a diff.**

- State your plan in one or two sentences before editing. For anything non-trivial, produce a numbered list of steps with a verification check for each.
- Read the files you will touch. Read the files that call the files you will touch. Claude Code: use subagents for exploration so the main context stays clean.
- Match existing patterns in the codebase. If the project uses pattern X, use pattern X, even if you'd do it differently in a greenfield repo.
- Surface assumptions out loud: "I'm assuming you want X, Y, Z. If that's wrong, say so." Do not bury assumptions inside the implementation.
- If two approaches exist, present both with tradeoffs. Do not pick one silently. Exception: trivial tasks (typo, rename, log line) where the diff fits in one sentence.

---

## 2. Writing code: simplicity first

**Goal: the minimum code that solves the stated problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code. No configurability, flexibility, or hooks that were not requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios. Handle the failures that can actually happen.
- If the solution runs 200 lines and could be 50, rewrite it before showing it.
- If you find yourself adding "for future extensibility", stop. Future extensibility is a future decision.
- Bias toward deleting code over adding code. Shipping less is almost always better.

The test: would a senior engineer reading the diff call this overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

---

## 3. Surgical changes

**Goal: clean, reviewable diffs. Change only what the request requires.**

- Do not "improve" adjacent code, comments, formatting, or imports that are not part of the task.
- Do not refactor code that works just because you are in the file.
- Do not delete pre-existing dead code unless asked. If you notice it, mention it in the summary.
- Do clean up orphans created by your own changes (unused imports, variables, functions your edit made obsolete).
- Match the project's existing style exactly: indentation, quotes, naming, file layout.

The test: every changed line traces directly to the user's request. If a line fails that test, revert it.

---

## 4. Goal-driven execution

**Goal: define success as something you can verify, then loop until verified.**

Rewrite vague asks into verifiable goals before starting:

- "Add validation" becomes "Write tests for invalid inputs (empty, malformed, oversized), then make them pass."
- "Fix the bug" becomes "Write a failing test that reproduces the reported symptom, then make it pass."
- "Refactor X" becomes "Ensure the existing test suite passes before and after, and no public API changes."
- "Make it faster" becomes "Benchmark the current hot path, identify the bottleneck with profiling, change it, show the benchmark is faster."

For every task:

1. State the success criteria before writing code.
2. Write the verification (test, script, benchmark, screenshot diff) where practical.
3. Run the verification. Read the output. Do not claim success without checking.
4. If the verification fails, fix the cause, not the test.

---

## 5. Tool use and verification

- Prefer running the code to guessing about the code. If a test suite exists, run it. If a linter exists, run it. If a type checker exists, run it.
- Never report "done" based on a plausible-looking diff alone. Plausibility is not correctness.
- When debugging, address root causes, not symptoms. Suppressing the error is not fixing the error.
- For UI changes, verify visually: screenshot before, screenshot after, describe the diff.
- Use CLI tools (gh, aws, gcloud, kubectl) when they exist. They are more context-efficient than reading docs or hitting APIs unauthenticated.
- When reading logs, errors, or stack traces, read the whole thing. Half-read traces produce wrong fixes.

---

## 6. Session hygiene

- Context is the constraint. Long sessions with accumulated failed attempts perform worse than fresh sessions with a better prompt.
- After two failed corrections on the same issue, stop. Summarize what you learned and ask the user to reset the session with a sharper prompt.
- Use subagents (Claude Code: "use subagents to investigate X") for exploration tasks that would otherwise pollute the main context with dozens of file reads.
- When committing, write descriptive commit messages (subject under 72 chars, body explains the why). No "update file" or "fix bug" commits. No "Co-Authored-By: Claude" attribution unless the project explicitly wants it.

---

## 7. Communication style

- Direct, not diplomatic. "This won't scale because X" beats "That's an interesting approach, but have you considered...".
- Concise by default. Two or three short paragraphs unless the user asks for depth. No padding, no restating the question, no ceremonial closings.
- When a question has a clear answer, give it. When it does not, say so and give your best read on the tradeoffs.
- Celebrate only what matters: shipping, solving genuinely hard problems, metrics that moved. Not feature ideas, not scope creep, not "wouldn't it be cool if".
- No excessive bullet points, no unprompted headers, no emoji. Prose is usually clearer than structure for short answers.

---

## 8. When to ask, when to proceed

**Ask before proceeding when:**
- The request has two plausible interpretations and the choice materially affects the output.
- The change touches something you've been told is load-bearing, versioned, or has a migration path.
- You need a credential, a secret, or a production resource you don't have access to.
- The user's stated goal and the literal request appear to conflict.

**Proceed without asking when:**
- The task is trivial and reversible (typo, rename a local variable, add a log line).
- The ambiguity can be resolved by reading the code or running the command.
- The user has already answered the question once in this session.

---

## 9. Self-improvement loop

**This file is living. Keep it short by keeping it honest.**

After every session where the agent did something wrong:

1. Ask: was the mistake because this file lacks a rule, or because the agent ignored a rule?
2. If lacking: add the rule under "Project Learnings" below, written as concretely as possible ("Always use X for Y" not "be careful with Y").
3. If ignored: the rule may be too long, too vague, or buried. Tighten it or move it up.
4. Every few weeks, prune. For each line, ask: "Would removing this cause the agent to make a mistake?" If no, delete. Bloated AGENTS.md files get ignored wholesale.

Boris Cherny (creator of Claude Code) keeps his team's file around 100 lines. Under 300 is a good ceiling. Over 500 and you are fighting your own config.

---

## 10. Project context

**Fill this in per project. Keep it specific. Delete sections that don't apply.**

### Stack
- Language and version: TypeScript 7.0.2 (strict), target ESNext
- Framework(s): React 19.2.8, Vite 8.1.5, Tailwind CSS 4.3.3 (`@tailwindcss/vite`)
- Package manager: User choice (e.g. bun, yarn, npm)
- Runtime / deployment target: **both** the browser SPA (Vite build, Wasm cores) and the Tauri desktop app (native Rust cores). Keep both working: the browser path (`src/workers`, `src/wasm`, `src/utils/zipExtractor.ts`, `wasm/zip-core`) is a supported target, not legacy.

### Commands
- Install: `<package-manager> install`
- Build: `<package-manager> run build`
- Test (all): `TODO` (no test script in package.json)
- Test (single file): `TODO`
- Lint: `<package-manager> run lint` (`oxlint && tsc --noEmit`); fix: `<package-manager> run lint:fix`
- Format: `<package-manager> run fmt` (`oxfmt`); check: `<package-manager> run fmt:check`
- Typecheck: `<package-manager> run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`)
- Rebuild Wasm: `<package-manager> run wasm:build` (only after editing `wasm/*/src`; needs `wasm-bindgen` 0.2.126 + `wasm-opt` on PATH, then commit the regenerated `src/wasm/*`)
- Bench (PM2): `<package-manager> run bench`
- Bench (Mongo): `<package-manager> run bench:mongo`
- Bench (Zip): `<package-manager> run bench:zip`
- Bench (native/Tauri UI-ready): `<package-manager> run bench:native -- <logfile> [--runs N]` (needs `pnpm tauri build --no-bundle` first; drives the real app over WebView2 CDP, logs to stderr, result JSON to stdout)
- Bench (native ZIP UI-ready): `<package-manager> run bench:native:zip` (benchmarks `methaq-api&mongodb-07-09.zip`)
- Run locally: `<package-manager> run dev`
- Preview build: `<package-manager> run preview`

Prefer single-file or single-test runs during iteration. Full suites are for the final verification pass.

### Layout
- Source lives in: `src/` (`components/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`, `workers/`, plus `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, `index.css`)
- Tests live in: `TODO` (no test directory or test runner configured; `test_data/` holds sample log files only)
- Do not modify: `node_modules/`, `dist/` (generated build output)

### Conventions specific to this repo
- Naming: PascalCase React components (`FileDrop.tsx`); camelCase utils/hooks (`pm2LogParser.ts`, `useParserWorker.ts`)
- Import style: relative imports (`../utils/...`); `import type` for type-only imports (`verbatimModuleSyntax`); `@` path alias exists in `vite.config.ts` but is unused in source today
- React & Zustand code pattern:
  - **Module-level action extraction**: Do NOT export individual action functions from store definitions. In consumers, extract actions at module scope: `const { action1, action2 } = useAnalysisStore.getState();` instead of inline selector hooks or repetitive inline `getState()` calls.
  - **Standalone functions outside React**: Define business logic, parser operations (`parseFile`, `parseFiles`, `parseText`, `reaggregate`, `cancel`, `clear`), data exports (`exportSpreadsheetData`), copy helpers (`copyApiPath`, `copyCronTsv`), and sorting handlers outside React components as pure standalone exports.
  - **Zero `useEffect` for state sync or workers**: Initialize singletons (workers) at module load. Execute DOM effects (e.g. theme toggle `document.documentElement.classList.toggle`) directly inside store actions. Trigger operational effects (`reaggregate()`) directly in event handlers without intermediate timeouts, `scheduleReaggregate` wrappers, or store `subscribe` loops.
  - **Grouped `useShallow` selectors**: When a component needs multiple reactive state properties, use a single `useAnalysisStore(useShallow((s) => ({ ... })))` to avoid fragmented multi-hook subscriptions and spurious re-renders.
  - **On-demand snapshot reads**: If a state value is only needed inside a click handler (e.g., current sort direction or table rows during copy), read it on demand via `useAnalysisStore.getState().prop` rather than subscribing the component to it.
- Anti-slop: Do NOT use `typeof window !== "undefined"` or `typeof document !== "undefined"` in client-only code; access them directly. Do NOT create custom listener registration abstractions (`onWorkerFilterChange`) when direct function calls suffice.

### Forbidden
- No `useEffect` for worker lifecycles, timer debounce loops, or theme toggling.
- No exporting action functions individually from store files.
- No synthetic event bus / listener registration abstractions where direct calls work.

## 11. Project Learnings

**Accumulated corrections. This section is for the agent to maintain, not just the human.**

When the user corrects your approach, append a one-line rule here before ending the session. Write it concretely ("Always use X for Y"), never abstractly ("be careful with Y"). If an existing line already covers the correction, tighten it instead of adding a new one. Remove lines when the underlying issue goes away (model upgrades, refactors, process changes).

- React/Zustand architecture (2026-08-15): extract store actions at module scope (`const { ... } = useStore.getState()`), keep operations (`parseFile`, `reaggregate`, `exportSpreadsheetData`, copy/sort handlers) as pure standalone exports outside React, and avoid wrapping direct calls in `useEffect`, custom observer callbacks (`onWorkerFilterChange`), or artificial timeout debounce wrappers.
- Direct DOM & action side-effects (2026-08-15): toggle DOM classes (e.g. `.dark`) directly in store actions (`toggleTheme`, `setTheme`) and trigger consequence actions (`reaggregate()`) directly in caller event handlers without `useStore.subscribe` loops.
- Multi-prop selectors (2026-08-15): group component reactive state with `useShallow((s) => ({ ... }))`; read event-only values on demand via `useStore.getState().prop`.
- Same-file edits (2026-09-25): serialize edits to a file; parallelize only across disjoint paths, and use byte-preserving targeted edits when line endings matter.
- Rust/Wasm persistent shards (2026-07-25): ship when ingest writes into an 8 MiB reusable Wasm window (`ingest_ptr` + `feed`), columns stay in-shard, summary is built once at `end_shard`, and reagg uses dense slots + HashMap RelHist. Full-shard TypedArray→Rust copies + dual JS/Wasm residency fail parse/RSS gates.
- Rust/Wasm opt pass (2026-07-25): keep required `wasm-opt -O3` + `memchr` empty-carry newline scan; revert RelHist-in-`accept_line` and hash→arena path intern (those regress). Prefer a quiet manual `npm run wasm:build` + bench session for gates — agent back-to-back Chromium runs can read ~100–150ms slower than a fresh user shell (session 31 manual: ~1.33s / 97ms vs agent ~1.48s).
- Rust deps (2026-07-25): use `hashbrown` 0.17 (default foldhash) instead of `ahash` on Wasm (no AES-NI); pin `wasm-bindgen`/`wasm-bindgen-cli` to the same version (0.2.126); `memchr` 2.8. On Windows prefer the GitHub release tarball for the CLI if `cargo install` fails on `dlltool.exe`.
- Rust modernize (2026-07-25): edition 2024; `rapidhash` for path/norm `ByteMap`s; `HashMap::entry_ref` intern; `normalize_path` → `Cow`; `memchr::memmem` for `[cron]`; reagg encodes `&summary_sketch` (no RelHist clone). Quiet manual bench is the gate (~1.28s/86ms); agent Chromium stacks can read a bit slower.
- Always use Context7 (then crates.io / official docs) for language APIs and package versions before choosing deps or “latest” patterns — do not rely on training cutoff. Rust `edition = "YYYY"` is an edition name (valid: 2015/2018/2021/2024 as of mid-2026), not the calendar year.
- Sub-1s cut (2026-07-25): cold `firstReagg` is mostly lazy `ensure_mode(collapseIds)`. Kick `ENSURE_MODE` on each `SHARD_PARSED` so early shards prewarm while siblings still feed — do **not** only fold ensure into `end_shard` (wall wash). Also: `memchr('[')` before cron `memmem`; frequency-order methods; `normalize_path` Borrowed when unchanged. Do **not** ship RelHist `summary_wire` at parse (≈+20 MB RSS, no wall win) — first reagg `needSummary=true` is enough; warm runs reuse `cachedSummary`. Quiet manual bench is the gate (agent Chromium ~100–150ms slower).
- 5GB memory/perf balance (2026-08-03): Chromium RSS scales ~+1 GiB per shard worker (each holds its own Wasm linear memory + columnar store), so the shard pool cap is the RSS lever, not the ingest window. Pre-commit pool was 4 workers (~3–3.9 GiB RSS); the b75f819 bump to 16 workers drove RSS to ~8 GiB. Restore = `Math.min(4, hc)`: 4 workers × 32 MiB ingest = 128 MiB committed, RSS back to ~3.5 GiB, wall 6.0 s / 893 MB/s (vs 5.4 s / 995 MB/s at 8 workers — ~0.6 s is the inherent price of fewer shards). Keep the 32 MiB `INGEST_CAP` (a 512 MiB window commits real zero-filled pages via `ingest.resize`) and `clear()` dropping all Vec/HashMap capacity. Revert the commit's flat `Vec<EndpointAcc>` dense reagg back to sparse `Vec<Option<Box<EndpointAcc>>>` (~80 B × n_norm×8 per shard saved). Worker Wasm heap (~2.4–2.7 GiB) is corpus-inherent columnar data (36.6M hits × 16 B + path/norm arenas), present before and after the commit — not a regression. The "1-shot per-shard arrayBuffer + 512MB INGEST_CAP → 1.82 s" experiment stays a failed approach: it multiplies memory with worker count and was never shipped.
- Oxlint anti-slop rules (2026-09-02): Disallow `Record<string, unknown>` in favor of named domain types (`MongoDoc`); avoid runtime `typeof` in favor of boundary decoding helpers (`Number.isFinite`, `String(x) === x`, constructor checks); require `// SAFETY:` justifications for type assertions; and keep heavy dependencies (`exceljs`) dynamically imported.
- Mongo slow query correctness (2026-09-03): require `"msg":"Slow query"` before ingesting duration (excludes administrative index builds and periodic progress duplicates); key pattern map by `(ns_id, op, plan_id, fp_id)` composite key and scope `query_hash_cache` by `(ns_id, query_hash)` to avoid cross-collection pattern/suggestion merging; remove sample duration caps in `reagg.rs`; and sort virtualized tables client-side via `useMemo`.
- Mongo Wasm perf & memory (2026-09-03): eliminate 2M+ runtime `Finder` constructions with `LazyLock<Finder>` statics; bound slow query metric scans to `tail` (4.8KB) and `header` (384B) to eliminate ~4GB of redundant backwards scans; replace `(String, u16)` LRU cache allocations with zero-alloc `last_*_id` indexing into existing arena Vecs; unroll ISO timestamp arithmetic; drop intermediate 98% progress message to eliminate React thread contention before RESULT; pipeline 16MB streaming chunks with `QUEUE_DEPTH = 3`. Parse wall dropped from 0.64s to 0.48s (throughput ~700–733 MB/s).
- Mongo feed & reagg acceleration (2026-09-03): use cascading forward cursor `extract_forward_*` after `planSummary` to drop tail scan bytes from 52KB/line to ~400B/line; cache date prefix epoch base in `parse_iso_epoch`; replace `conn_to_user` and `user_meta` HashMaps with `ctx_to_user` and `user_meta` dense Vec indexing; replace hourly `time_map` HashMap with `[Option<TimeBucketAcc>; 24]` to eliminate 56K heap string allocations; replace full op scan with bitmask `ops_mask`; and consume `matched_indices` in-place for top slow queries. Parse wall dropped from 0.46s to 0.36s (upload→KPI 0.37s, throughput 945 MB/s).
- Zip Wasm extraction & parallel worker pool (2026-09-08): parse ZIP central directory in <1ms on main thread to extract exact compressed slices (`data_start..data_start+comp_size`); route valid entries concurrently across a prewarmed Web Worker pool (`Math.min(hc, validEntries.length)`); use pure-Rust SIMD `zlib-rs` with `window_bits: -15` (RFC 1951 raw deflate) and `window_bits: 31` (gzip) decompressing into exact preallocated buffers; eliminate double/triple allocations by slicing `wasm.memory.buffer.slice(ptr, ptr+len)` directly into transferable `ArrayBuffer` and immediately clearing Wasm capacity. Dropped extraction wall from 1.89s to 0.67s (throughput jumped from 368 MB/s to 1032 MB/s, extraction RSS dropped >50%).
- Zip zero-copy direct snapshot & pipeline acceleration (2026-09-09): eliminate 728MB memset zeroing with `zlib_rs::inflate::uncompress` (`__internal-api` + `MaybeUninit`); parse central directory in 0.5ms from 65KB file tail without reading the 81MB archive; dispatch parallel blob slice handles to workers; construct `new File([view as BlobPart])` directly from Wasm linear memory view to eliminate 100ms `buffer.slice()` intermediate copies; pipeline parser dispatch eagerly when all entries of a category finish decompressing; and terminate extraction worker pool post-extract to reclaim ~1.2 GB RSS. Extraction wall dropped from 0.71s to 0.54s (throughput jumped to 1283 MB/s), upload→ready dropped from 1.89s to 1.42s (-470ms), and Chromium peak RSS plummeted from 3723 MB to 2477 MB (-1246 MB / -33%).
- Zip & Mongo direct transferable buffer pipeline (2026-09-09): eliminate 438MB Blink Blob storage allocation and 28 async Blob read cycles for extracted Mongo logs by slicing Wasm output into a transferable ArrayBuffer, passing it zero-copy via postMessage [buffer], and parsing via zero-alloc Uint8Array subarray stream in mongoParserWorker; sort extraction entries descending (LPT) and terminate each worker immediately when its job finishes to eliminate idle worker Wasm memory overlap with downstream parsers. Dropped Mongo parse wall from ~900ms to 376ms (-58%), upload→ready from 1.76s to 1.36s (-400ms / -23%), and Chromium peak RSS from 2481 MB to 1829 MB (-652 MB / -26.3%), breaking the 2 GB barrier.
- Zip & PM2 direct transferable buffer & zero-read sharding (2026-09-09): eliminate 256MB Blink Blob storage allocation and 16 async Blob read cycles for extracted PM2 logs by slicing Wasm output into transferable ArrayBuffers, eagerly passing to logParserWorker via PARSE_BUFFER, and sharding into transferable slices across shard workers via PARSE_SHARD_BUFFER; dropped shard readMs from 894.8ms to 0.0ms (-100%), dropped shardWallMaxMs from 1079.9ms to 194.4ms (-82%), and reduced Chromium peak RSS from 1835.3 MB to 1679.7 MB (-155.6 MB / -8.5%), eliminating all Blob storage allocations across the entire ZIP archive.
- Tauri native Rayon sharding & drop event collision (2026-09-12): on large files in Tauri desktop, guard DOM onDrop with isTauri() to prevent the web FileReader/Wasm pipeline from executing concurrently with native onDragDropEvent disk paths; partition mmap slices across Rayon threads (up to 16 shards) with LINE_EXTEND lookahead, emit native-progress events from worker threads, and default mode_code to 2 (collapseIds) to avoid 500MB+ exact-path allocation. Dropped 5.6GB parse wall from 11.0s to 1.85s (3024 MB/s, 20.3M hits).
- Tauri UI-ready latency (2026-09-12): `parse_wall_ms` alone hides the felt latency; the user-visible metric is upload→first-paint (rAF x2 after the KPI row appears), shown in the toast. Four fixes took the 5.6GB drop from ~3.1s to 1.52s: (1) native `parse_shard` fed the mmap slice directly via `feed_slice` instead of copying 5.6GB through the 32 MiB ingest window (-470ms); (2) `UnmapViewOfFile` of the 5.6GB view costs ~600ms on Windows, so hand the mmaps to a detached thread right after the Rayon parse; (3) return a fully finalized `AggregatedResult` JSON from Rust (`src-tauri/src/finalize.rs`) — no base64 wires, JS does `JSON.parse` only (~11ms), IPC payload 13MB → 1.9MB; (4) store a 96-bit fingerprint (hash+len+head) in the path table plus an 8192-slot direct-mapped cache so `intern_path` never touches the path arena on a probe (~100ms). Native command 2542ms → ~1380ms (parse+meta ~1.05s, reaggregate ~220ms, merge+finalize+JSON ~130ms). Keep the shard cap at `cpus.min(16)`: `cpus*2` (24 shards) overflowed a worker stack on the 5GB test.
- Native ZIP pipeline acceleration (2026-09-12): on ZIP archives in Tauri native, replace serial entry extraction and buffer zeroing with MaybeUninit zero-copy inflate, parallelize entry extraction with Rayon into_par_iter() sorted descending by compressed size (LPT), and pipeline PM2 and Mongo decompression and parsing concurrently via rayon::join. Dropped methaq-api&mongodb-07-09.zip UI-ready time from 1620ms down to 944ms (native wall ~740ms), beating WASM (1320ms) by ~400ms without regressing the 5.35GB raw log (3400+ MB/s).
- Native IPC zero-escape & cache-partitioned finalization (2026-09-12): use `Box<serde_json::value::RawValue>` for pre-serialized JSON in Tauri IPC commands to avoid Serde string escaping and eliminate secondary JS `JSON.parse` passes (dropping `assembleMs` from 30ms to 0-1ms); partition multi-shard finalization into 6 method tables and box 2KB `RelHist` sketches to keep hash tables cache-resident during merge; track `min_key..=max_key` in `RelHist` to avoid scanning empty buckets; dropped native ZIP UI-ready latency from 892ms baseline to 592–610ms (native wall ~454ms, ~137 MB/s archive throughput).
- Native commands must not run on the IPC thread (2026-09-12): `#[tauri::command]` defaults to `ExecutionContext::Blocking`, so a sync command body runs on the webview's IPC/main thread — the window stops pumping messages and every `native-progress` emit is queued until the command returns. `bench_native_tauri.mjs` measured `uiReady` only after the command returned, so a 460ms native ZIP parse that delivered zero progress updates looked 2× faster than WASM while feeling frozen. Make whole-file commands `async fn` + `tauri::async_runtime::spawn_blocking` (state via `AppHandle::state::<AppState>()`), share one `SharedProgress` byte counter across the concurrent PM2/Mongo pipelines (feed mongo in 16MiB `feed_slice` chunks so the bar moves), tag native requests with per-store sequence numbers in `nativeBridge.ts` so a slow reaggregate cannot overwrite a newer ingest, and judge native perf by DOM-update spread + frame gaps, not just `uiReady`.
- Mongo reagg output is not byte-stable (2026-09-12): `reaggregate` emits `patterns` in hash-map iteration order and numbers `pat-N`/`query-example-N` ids from that order, so two identical runs (or two calls on one engine) produce different JSON and ids. Never compare reagg JSON byte-wise in tests — canonicalize (sort arrays by content, drop `id`) as `test_mongo_chunked_feed_matches_single_shot` does; the unstable ids are a pre-existing UI hazard when a selected pattern survives a reaggregate.
- Rayon worker stacks must be raised (2026-09-12): rayon's default 2MB worker stack is not enough once a worker waits on a job and runs other jobs on the same stack (`rayon::join` → `par_iter`/`scope` pipelines). The failure is a nondeterministic `STATUS_STACK_OVERFLOW` (0xC00000FD) that only shows up in the app, not in a single-threaded test. `configure_rayon_pool()` builds the global pool with 16MB stacks and names the threads (`log-analyzer-N`, otherwise they show up as `<unknown>` in panic output); it costs address space, not committed memory.
- Decoder choice for ZIP entries (2026-09-12): libdeflate (`libdeflater`, vendored C, builds via cc) beats pure-Rust `zlib-rs` on log data by ~1.3x for whole-buffer inflate (pm2 268MB 237→172ms, mongo 458MB 265→203ms) and a zeroed `vec![0u8; n]` costs ~0ms (lazily-zeroed pages, same first-touch cost as the old `MaybeUninit` path), so use libdeflate where the whole entry is materialized. Whole-buffer inflate + parallel parse is the fastest PM2 ZIP path: streaming PM2 shards into parsers measured no better (inflate writes 242ms instead of 188ms because the concurrent parsers steal memory bandwidth; per-shard fresh 22MB windows cost another ~35ms) even with a recycled window pool, so keep libdeflate + `par_iter` shards for PM2.
- Streaming Mongo ZIP ingest (2026-09-12): `archive::DeflateStream` (resumable raw-deflate inflate from the stable `zlib_rs::Inflate`) feeding a consumer thread through a 3×8MiB `sync_channel` pool drops the methaq mongo branch from ~376ms to ~250ms and the app's peak working set from 842–911MB to 442–522MB, because the 437MB full-size buffer is never allocated and the 104ms engine feed overlaps the 210ms inflate. It only helps when the parse is smaller than the inflate — measuring both branches before picking a structure is mandatory here.
- IPC payload size is the dominant UI-ready cost after parsing (2026-09-12): the Tauri custom-protocol response transfers at ~10ms/MB on WebView2 (10.6MB → ~118ms of `invoke`-minus-`native` overhead, unaffected by switching to a raw `ArrayBuffer` body — V8's `JSON.parse` of a 7MB payload is only 8–11ms). Dropping the redundant per-row `key` (`method + ' ' + path`, rebuilt in `nativeBridge.restoreApiKeys`) and rounding display-only floats to 2 decimals shrinks the methaq PM2 JSON from 9.27MB to 5.85MB and UI-ready by ~30ms. Progress events are cheap (~5ms for 45 events) — do not throttle them for speed.
- Dual target: browser + desktop are both supported (2026-09-12). `src/wasm/pkg*` and `src/wasm/*Bytes.ts` are checked-in Wasm artifacts, so any change under `wasm/*/src` must be followed by `pnpm wasm:build` and a browser bench (`bench:zip`/`bench:mongo`), not just the native bench. They had drifted: the artifacts committed in `b3e0bbe` predated `MongoEngine::feed_slice` from the native streaming work, so the browser was running a Wasm built from older sources (functionally identical — the browser never calls `feed_slice` — and regenerating changed no numbers: both builds give 907,336 requests / 82,191 slow queries / 557 patterns on the methaq zip). Rule: after touching a shared core crate, run `cargo test` + `pnpm wasm:build` + one native bench + one browser bench, and commit the regenerated artifacts with the source change.
- Vite's dev watcher must ignore `src-tauri` (2026-09-12): `server.watch.ignored: ["**/src-tauri/**", "**/target/**"]`. `src-tauri/target` is 13GB/28k files, so a cargo/tauri build floods the dev server with watcher events and it stops answering module requests (measured: 16.4s to first paint under a build, 2.6–5.8s per 179-byte 304; 1.5s once ignored, 0.5s idle). Symptom to recognize: DevTools shows tiny cached responses taking seconds, which means the server, not the browser, is stalled — a slow dev load is never the app code, and building the Rust side while testing `pnpm dev` will always look like an app regression unless this is set.
- Rust native build acceleration (2026-09-13): avoid monolithic fat LTO (`lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`, `link.exe`) in Tauri release profiles — it serializes LLVM optimizations across 200+ crates on a single thread and drives single-file rebuilds to ~110s. Use `lto = "thin"`, `codegen-units = 16`, `strip = "symbols"`, and `-C linker=rust-lld` on MSVC. Single-file rebuilds drop from 110s to 15–38s (3–7× faster) and clean builds from >2m to 1m44s, while maintaining 3600+ MB/s native ingest throughput.
- Native Mongo sharded pipeline & UI-ready latency (2026-09-13): partition raw mmap slices into 16–32MB shards across Rayon threads with 256KB line-extend, merge local arena IDs into global IDs in <2ms, and drop mmaps on a background detached thread to eliminate Windows UnmapViewOfFile stalls. Return MongoReaggResult with Box<RawValue> for zero-copy IPC delivery without string escaping. Methaq 352MB native parse wall dropped from 405ms to 57ms (7.1× faster, 5,893 MB/s), UI-ready dropped from 476ms to 104ms (3,230 MB/s), and real reaggregations run in 14–24ms with zero UI freeze.
- PM2 shard pipeline and finalizer acceleration (2026-09-13): pipeline `reaggregate_decoded` directly in `tasks.into_par_iter()` worker tasks in `parse_pm2_raw_mmaps` and `parse_pm2_items` to eliminate cold-cache passes and Rayon re-dispatch; store precomputed 64-bit `hash` and `Box<RelHist>` in `DecodedEndpoint` to drop endpoint struct size from 2088B to 48B and hash map buckets from 2120B to 72B; partition endpoint merging into 16 lock-free hash buckets in `finalize_pm2_with_partials` with Rayon; and skip empty sparse hash tables in `RelHist::merge`. Dropped 535MB raw PM2 parse/ui-ready to 196ms/234ms (2286 MB/s, 2.03M requests); methaq ZIP native wall is ~352–365ms and UI-ready averages ~512ms (bounded by libdeflater sequential decompression of 727MB logs + 5.85MB IPC payload).
- Mongo Wasm sharded ingestion & memory reclamation (2026-09-13): parallelize browser MongoDB log analysis with dedicated Web Worker shards feeding 100MB chunks via zero-alloc wasm ingest windows (`ingest_ptr` + `parse_shard_ingest`); transfer columnar shard data and string arenas via compact binary wire format (`encode_shard` + `merge_shard_bytes`) to eliminate JSON postMessage overhead; terminate worker pool post-parse to reclaim worker Wasm linear memory immediately (-50% peak RSS from 667MB down to 335MB); and keep `&[u8]` slice methods (`parse_shard`, `feed_slice`) outside wasm-bindgen for zero-copy native Tauri mmap usage only. Throughput reached 1,074 MB/s, parse wall dropped to 313ms, and 100% metric parity is preserved across browser and desktop.
- Tailwind v4 source scoping & Vite HTML crawler (2026-09-13): by default, Tailwind CSS v4 scans the whole project root (all 28k files and Rust/Cargo code in src-tauri), taking 2.3s in Register dependency messages on every CSS transform in dev and build; use `@import "tailwindcss" source(none);` with explicit `@source "../index.html";` and `@source "./**";` in `src/index.css` to drop build time from 2.7s down to 400ms (pre-tauri level). Also set `optimizeDeps: { entries: ["index.html"] }` in `vite.config.ts` so Vite never crawls `src-tauri/target` (which contains 200+ cargo doc/timings HTML files) during dependency discovery (ready in 20ms vs 122ms).
- Native result transport & UI-ready latency (2026-09-13): the Tauri IPC custom protocol is capped at ~140MB/s on WebView2 regardless of body type (`Response<Vec<u8>>` 136MB/s, JSON string 110MB/s, ~3.5ms fixed overhead) — the methaq 7.2MB payload spent ~90ms of `invoke` on transfer, not on JSON.parse (V8 parses 4.7MB in 4.4ms). `PayloadServer` in `src-tauri/src/payload.rs` publishes result JSON to an ephemeral 127.0.0.1 listener with a per-process random path token and commands return a small `PayloadRef`; the webview fetches it in `nativeBridge.readPayload` (fetches run in `Promise.all`). Measured ~300MB/s for the same bytes. Methaq ZIP ui-ready 486ms avg / 464ms min → 447ms / 422ms; mongo raw 110ms → 105ms and reagg 19.3ms → 16ms. The `invoke`/`assemble` split now reads ~14ms invoke + ~45ms assemble, which is expected — `uiReadyMs` is unchanged in definition.
- Native inflate/normalize/quantile hot spots (2026-09-13): (1) libdeflate's output buffer is zeroed and faulted page-by-page as it writes, which costs ~25ms wall on the 727MB methaq ZIP — `pre_fault()` (8 threads touching one byte per 4KB) before `deflate_decompress` is worth ~25ms; `PrefetchVirtualMemory` does NOT populate PTEs (it is only a read-ahead hint) and `read()` into heap buffers is slower than mmap. (2) `normalize_path` scanned each path twice and allocated per collapsing path — `normalize_into(path, mode, &mut scratch)` collapses in one pass and halves ensure-mode CPU (1315ms → 710ms for 2.74M paths) though wall only drops ~35ms because it was already parallel across shards. (3) `RelHist::quantiles4_ms` called `GAMMA.powf()` per populated bucket per endpoint — cache the dense key range in a `OnceLock<[f32; 512]>`. (4) 16 endpoint-merge buckets on 12 rayon workers left a 2-round tail; 64 buckets pack it. Multi-run `bench:native` on the 5GB file has ±250ms variance, so judge parser changes with `.tmp-diag`-style standalone A/B (same-thread-count, `NOWARM` variants) instead of the GUI bench.
- Wasm batch import acceleration & direct shard partitioning (2026-09-26): in multi-archive imports (bench_import_batch), replace serial extraction with a parallel worker pool running LPT-sorted entries across all archives; eagerly dispatch Mongo via parseMongoBuffer immediately when its entry finishes; partition PM2 items directly into 4 shard buffers on the main thread while freeing each item buffer, and pass prepartitioned shard buffers to logParserWorker via PARSE_SHARD_BUFFERS to eliminate the 1.08GB single-buffer allocation and 2.5s Blink Blob IPC read overhead. Dropped batch upload→ready from 5,987ms to 3,035ms (-49.3%), dropped PM2 stages.readMs from 2,506ms to 0.0ms, and reduced RSS after import from 3,140MB to 2,768MB (-372MB) while preserving 100% data parity across all 3.72M PM2 requests and 81.8K Mongo slow queries.
- Native batch import pipelining & zero-copy finalization (2026-09-26): in multi-archive / batch imports, replace sequential archive traversal with concurrent `par_iter` candidate expansion, pipeline decompression directly into worker shards (`parse_pm2_slice` / `parse_mongo_slice` per entry) so buffer memory is freed immediately instead of holding 1.55 GB in RAM, eliminate `pre_fault` OS thread spawning that thrashes Rayon worker pools during parallel decompress, and consume `DecodedEndpoint` fields by value in `ApiMethodMaps::absorb` with zero-alloc `String::from_utf8`. Dropped batch native wall time from 1,201ms to 597ms (2.01× faster) and batch `uiReadyMs` from 1,430ms to 838ms (-41.4%) with 100% data parity.

## 12. How this file was built

This boilerplate synthesizes:
- Sean Donahoe's IJFW ("It Just F\*cking Works") principles: one install, working code, no ceremony.
- Andrej Karpathy's observations on LLM coding pitfalls (the four principles: think-first, simplicity, surgical changes, goal-driven execution).
- Boris Cherny's public Claude Code workflow (reactive pruning, keep it ~100 lines, only rules that fix real mistakes).
- Anthropic's official Claude Code best practices (explore-plan-code-commit, verification loops, context as the scarce resource).
- Community anti-sycophancy patterns (explicit banned phrases, direct-not-diplomatic).
- The AGENTS.md open standard (cross-tool portability via symlinks).
